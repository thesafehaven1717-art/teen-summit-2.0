## What is Teen Summit 2.0?

Teen Summit 2.0 is a reimagined civic media platform that empowers young people through debate, musicology, and podcasting. It's a 12-week program (Spring 2026) where selected teens—called "Summiters"—participate in an elite, world-class educational experience combining academic rigor with modern media production.

### The Program Structure: Three Acts of Transformation

**ACT I: Debate**
- Teens learn structured argumentation and critical thinking
- Develop public speaking skills
- Engage in evidence-based discussions on important issues

**ACT II: Musicology**
- Study music as cultural practice and knowledge production
- Learn DJ turntablism, sampling, and beat-making
- Understand hip-hop culture and creative collaboration

**ACT III: Podcast**
- Professional media production and broadcasting
- Create compelling audio narratives
- Build personal brands through media

### Program Completion: The Pinning Ceremony
After completing all three acts, Summiters participate in a formal Pinning Ceremony where they receive an official Teen Summit 2.0 pin, symbolizing their mastery of civic discourse, cultural knowledge, and media literacy.
